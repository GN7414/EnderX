### July 3rd: Sketched up different basic configurations
Today I set up the inital github repo and worked on trying to decide on a configuration. There are a lot of different ways to use the frame parts from an Ender-3. I took inspiration from the [Ender-3 NG]([url](https://www.printables.com/model/922401-ender-3-ng-v12-corexy-conversion)) and the [Ender 3 V2 CoreXY (2nd Gen)]([url](https://www.printables.com/model/602750-ender-3-v2-corexy-2nd-gen)). I was trying to leave space for an IDEX toolhead on each side, but that is not too easy. Then I looked at the belt pathing for a CoreXY IDEX and I found why there are not really any of this type of printer out there. This was the best configuration I found:![15_800x400](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9458b3c-5263-4b4b-a0f1-541bdaa5bcf4) I decided that I am instead going to make one toolhead with 2 seperate nozzles in a configuration similar to the BambuLab H2D. This configuration will be a lot cheaper than IDEX, though the software will probably be more complicated. Klipper to the rescue! Here are the 2 configurations so far using the stock frame parts: ![Screenshot 2025-07-03 170521](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07f26701-cb2c-47be-832e-208728c07899) ![Screenshot 2025-07-03 170539](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a11f236-5bf3-4b98-8697-b78b9ca1a4a2)
